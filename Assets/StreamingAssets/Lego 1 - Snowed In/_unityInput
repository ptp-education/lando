	Hi everyone! How are you doing today, you all good?

	STUDENTS RESPOND

	TA
	Great! Hey, who here likes comic books? Hands up…

	STUDENTS RESPOND

	TA
	Oh, a lot of you I see. I like comic books too – it’s so exciting to follow the stories of all those interesting characters! And you know, even if you don’t like comics, maybe you like the superhero movies that are based on them? Yeah? Who likes the Marvel movies? 

	STUDENTS RESPOND

	TA
	Hey, why don’t we play a very quick game to get to know each other? We’ll go around and you tell me your name and which superhero you would most like to be. Real quick, like this: “I’m [name], and I’d like to be [superhero]!” Your turn – 

	STUDENTS RESPOND

	TA
	Cool! Well it looks like we’ve got a room full of heroes all right. Which is handy, cos we’ve got some fun, hero-sized challenges for you all over the next half hour. And guess where I’m headed right now! See that store? 

	<i>Indicate to comic book store</i>

	TA
	That’s the best comic book store in town, and my friend Lando runs it. Let’s meet him, shall we, and see what new comics he has today?

	<i>Look at Lando</i>
	Hey Lando!

	LANDO
	Oh, hey bud, great to see you!

	DIDI
	Hello-oo, old chum! I see you’re in fine fettle!

	TA
	<i>laughing at Didi’s eccentricities</i>
	Didi, so good to see you here today too!

A1-0.2
A1-0.2LOOP
	DIDI
	And who are all these other lovely chums you’ve brought with you?

	TA
	Oh, yeah, these are my friends! Everyone – say hello to Lando and Didi!

	STUDENTS RESPOND

A1-0.3
A1-0.2LOOP
	LANDO
	Hey!

	DIDI
	Absolutely delighted to meet you!

	LANDO
	Your timing is perfect. We’ve just been reading the new issue of “Agent Ace!”. It’s about a dashing British secret agent who works for MI6…

	TA
	MI6?

A1-0.4
A1-0.2LOOP
	DIDI
	It stands for “Military Intelligence 6” – it’s the British equivalent of the CIA. So a government organization that is full of agents and spies... 

	TA
	Ooohhh

A1-0.5
A1-0.5LOOP
	LANDO
	And the MI6’s top spy – Ace Trousers – he’s super smart, highly-skilled…

	DIDI
	…and devilishly charming!

	LANDO
	Agent Ace Trousers… always on a mission on behalf of his government, his country, and Her Majesty The Queen…

	TA
	<i>As Lando and Didi slide out</i>
	Wait... where are you guys going?

A1-0.6

	<i>Scene transitions into secret labratory</i>

	TA
	Woah, what’s happening? Wait... I think we’re in Lando’s imagination – wild!

B1-0.1
B1-0.1LOOP
	Didi walks in dressed in a lab coat.

	TA
	What is this place?

B1-0.2
B1-0.2LOOP
	DIDI (ZED)
	This is the MI6 tech workshop. You, and the rest of this team of new agents, have been training here!

	Lando walks in wearing classic secret agent gear – black combat pants and turtleneck.

	DIDI
	And you must be Agent Trousers?

	LANDO (ACE)
	(Attempting an awful British accent, trying to be smooth)
	‘ello. You can call me Ace… 

	DIDI
	I’ll stick to calling you Trousers...

	And maybe you should stick to your American accent...

	Lando
	Heh, heh.

	DIDI
	Team, your mission is to rescue the British Ambassador to Canada. Earlier today, she was hiking when she got caught in an avalanche. 

	Luckily, she’s found safety in a nearby cave, but we need to get her out of this very silly mess.

	LANDO
	So-oo, we’re headed into snow for this rescue mission?

	Team, what sort of equipment do you think we should take with us?

	TA
	<i>Facilitate answers. Can look around room for inspiration. Skis, snowshoes, tuxedo</i>

		Skis

B1-1.0LOOP
	DIDI
	On top of those ideas, let me show you some of what I’ve been inventing in the lab. 

	These sandals have a built-in transmitter that will play the raddest surf tunes in every speaker within a 10-mile radius.

	LANDO
	Um… okay…

	DIDI
	Now this may look like an ordinary surfboard, but it has a hidden rocket booster. Just set it to autopilot and you’ll be back at base in no time. 

	TA
	These are very interesting... I just think maybe...

B1-1.1
B1-1.0LOOP
	DIDI
	What?

	LANDO
	They're better suited to a warm... beach mission?

	DIDI
	Oh, yes. I guess I've been daydreaming of finally getting a vacation.

B2-0.0
B2-0.0LOOP
	DIDI
	Hmm... I also built this. It packs up small but, if you press this button...

	Lando and TA
	Oh wow!

	DIDI
	I call this the porta-bridge! It can help you across icy canyons...

	LANDO
	Or we could hide under it to avoid falling rocks and snow...

	TA
	This could be very useful. But how can something so small also be so strong?

B2-0.1
B2-0.0LOOP
	DIDI
	Why don’t we each trying making a portable, but strong bridge ourselves to understand!

	Lando
	Great idea! We can all build our own versions...

	TA
	And test them out afterwards! I’ve got a bottle of water here and two books to lift up my bridge.

B2-0.2
B2-0.0LOOP
	Lando
	Any guidance before we start?

	Didi
	Hmm... let me ask you this, team...

	Does anyone know why the bricks on a brick wall overlap each other, so that the edges don’t all line up?

	STUDENTS RESPOND

	<i>Correct answer: makes wall stronger</i>

		No response
			B2-0.3
			B2-0.0LOOP
				Lando
				Is it because that makes the wall stronger?

				DIDI
				Exactly!

				TA
				Ah, so we should try something similar.

				Okay everyone, ready to get building? Maybe we spend 10 minutes on this experiment?

		Good points
			B2-0.4
			B2-0.0LOOP
				TA
				Those are good points. It also makes the wall stronger, right?

				<i>Go next when kids agree that overlapping bricks makes the wall stronger.</i>

		No response
			B2-0.5
			B2-0.0LOOP
				DIDI
				Exactly! It makes the wall stronger!

				TA
				Ah, so we should try something similar.

				Okay everyone, ready to get building? Maybe we spend 10 minutes on this experiment?

B2-0.5
B2-0.5LOOP
	DIDI
	Trousers! We should help too—let’s try other ways of building a porta-bridge that we can test out.

	LANDO
	Roger!

	<i>Set a timer for 10 minutes, and help kids build a bridge with overlapping pieces</i>

	<i>TA build the wrong bridge, with bricks stacked on top of each other with no support</i>

B2-0.5LOOP
B2-0.5LOOP
	TA
	Alright, I think we’re ready!

B2-1.0
B2-1.0LOOP
	LANDO
	Wait! Before we try your bridges, let’s test mine!

	TA
	So it looks like you stacked a bunch of bricks on top of each other...

	Let’s put this on its side and give that a try.

	<i>TA puts a heavy object on the bridge, and it collapses</i>

B2-1.1
B2-1.0LOOP
	DIDI
	[Laughs] I bet your porta-bridges will be stronger than that!

	TA
	Yeah, why don’t we go around and have everyone test their bridges!

		Not many pieces
			B2-1.3
			B2-1.0LOOP
				DIDI
				You really didn't need to use very many pieces. Good job!

		I agree
			B2-1.4
			B2-1.0LOOP
				DIDI
				I agree

		Good point
			B2-1.5
			B2-1.0LOOP
				LANDO
				Ooooh good point!

		Not many pieces
			B2-1.6
			B2-1.0LOOP
				LANDO
				Hahaha, well at least your bridge didn't break as easily as mine.

B2-2.0
B2-2.0LOOP
	DIDI
	Well here you are trousers. And please don't do anything silly with it. Good luck team.

	LANDO
	Let's go! Uh oops, I'll fix that when I get back?

	DIDI
	Ugh, I really need that beach holiday.

D1-0.0
D1-0.0LOOP
	LANDO
	The Ambassador! We’ve found her.

	Didi
	You’re Ace Trousers!? Gosh, thank you for coming to rescue me!

	Didi
	Oh no! It’s another avalanche! The roof barely held last time; it’ll definitely collapse this time!

	TA
	Oh, oh, it’s okay – Ace! We can build some secure walls then you can use the Porta-Bridge as a roof!

D1-0.1
D1-0.3LOOP
	LANDO
	Oh, yes, yes. Now, where did I… 

	Uhh...

	TA
	(Overtop Lando’s extended Uhh)
	Uhh?!

	LANDO
	(Embarrassed)
	Uhh...

	TA
	(Overtop Lando’s extended Uhh)
	Ace?!

D1-0.3
D1-0.3LOOP
	LANDO
	I maaay have forgotten it at the airport. 

	Didi
	WHAT are we going to do? We’re going to look so SILLY! 

	LANDO
	Everybody stay calm. 

	(To students)
	You all remember what we learned about building strong structures, don’t you?

	STUDENTS RESPOND

D1-0.4
D1-0.4LOOP
	LANDO
	Good! Because I wasn’t really paying attention… 

	Could you each build something to protect us, on both the top and sides, from the falling snow and rubble?

	Didi
	It needs to be strong and stable, so that it holds together and protects us until the avalanche is over!

	Lando
	And I’ll take inspiration from your ideas for what I build!

	Rumble sounds

	Didi
	Please hurry!

	TA
	Okay team, everyone clear on what we need to do?

	Let’s get to it!

D1-0.5
D1-0.5LOOP
	Didi
	Shall we have a cup of tea while we wait?

	LANDO
	Of course!

	TA
	<i>Set 10 minute timer, help kids build a stable structure</i>

D1-0.5LOOP
D1-0.5LOOP
	TA
	Okay, I think we’ve got some great ideas here. 

D1-1.0
D1-1.0LOOP
	LANDO
	Marvelous, what’s the plan?

	TA
	<i>Comment on each child's creation</i>

		Interlocking bricks
			D1-1.1
			D1-1.0LOOP
				LANDO
				Interlocking bricks! Yes that is exactly what Didi suggested.

		Barrier on the top
			D1-1.2
			D1-1.0LOOP
				DIDI
				A barrier along the top, just what we needed!

		Colorful
			D1-1.3
			D1-1.0LOOP
				LANDO
				Color, why not!

		Special pieces
			D1-1.4
			D1-1.0LOOP
				LANDO
				Ahhh, using those special pieces.

		Brilliant

				DIDI
				Brilliant!

	<i>Wait for avalanche sequence to end</i>

	TA
	Uh, did you remember to build a door?

D1-2.1
D1-2.0LOOP
	LANDO
	Don’t worry, it’s only a mine—er problem.

	<i>No-one gets it.</i>

	LANDO
	Because we’re in a mine… so like minor? Never mind...

E1-0.1LOOP
	TA
	Woah! That was epic!

E1-0.1
E1-0.1LOOP
	LANDO
	Yep. That’s Agent Ace! Thrills every time. 

	TA
	Wow. Hey, I feel like we learned a lot on your imaginary adventure. 

E1-0.2
E1-0.2LOOP
	DIDI
	Yes, I rather think that was largely my contribution…

	LANDO
	Sure was Didi, you’re super smart. We learned uh…

	DIDI
	That bricks are pretty useless lumps until you interlock them, at which point they become immensely strong and stable! 

	LANDO
	We also learned… that I look great in a turtleneck!

	TA
	(to students)
	Well, I hope you all had fun today. 

E1-0.3
E1-0.2LOOP
	LANDO
	Thanks for visiting, buds!

	DIDI

	ALL
	Bye Bye!
